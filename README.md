# LA County COVID-19 Information by City (LACI)

LA County Department of Public Health has been publishing data on COVID-19 cases in LA County at
http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/locations.htm. Unfortunately, it only provides
data by date at the county level but not at the city/community level. This is a problem because LA
is a large county, and I think people would be more interested in the situation in their local community.
LACI rectifies this by importing the City/Community Table at
http://dashboard.publichealth.lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/
every day and presenting data over time at the city/community level.
